Definitely!\nCurrently, the blog is not fully developed yet,\nbut I already feel <strong>a huge improvement in the speed and ease of delivering new functionalities</strong>.\nI’m only limited by my imagination ;)</p>\n<p>Finally <strong>extending my blog functionalities became a pleasure for me</strong>.\nI have always been a fan of generators and WYMIWYG (<em>What You Mean Is What You Get</em>) editors.\nDuring my studies, I preferred to write all my theses and reports in <a href=\"https://www.latex-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">LaTeX</a> instead of MS Word.\nIt seems to me that the same is the case with the creation of my blog.</p>\n<p>Another advantage is that <strong>I don’t have to pay for anything else than the domain</strong>.\nThe blog is hosted on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Github Pages</a>.\nEven if one day this service stops working or is no longer free,\nthere are tons of other places that allow you to host static pages for free.\nMigration is limited to uploading files and changing the IP address in the domain configuration.</p>\n<p>Since my blog now consists of regular static files, <strong>the performance of the site is much better</strong>\nand <strong>I don’t have to worry too much about security issues</strong>.\n<strong>All my posts are written in markdown</strong>, so if I decided to use a different tool in the future, another migration would not be a problem.\nThe posts are likely to be untouched.</p>\n<p>The last important advantage for me is <strong>no need to have a backup copy or website versioning</strong>.\nI don’t have to worry about it, because all the code needed to generate the blog is versioned on Github and on my computer.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I Migrated My Blog From Wordpress to Gatsby","date":"25 April 2021","description":null,"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/5267c/featured.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/7284f/featured.jpg 750w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/29ba9/featured.jpg 1080w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/c8896/featured.jpg 1366w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/5267c/featured.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/b0356/featured.avif 750w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/48f75/featured.avif 1080w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/a5094/featured.avif 1366w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/f46cf/featured.avif 1920w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/57584/featured.webp 750w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/984df/featured.webp 1080w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/4a276/featured.webp 1366w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/9c00f/featured.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.6666666666666666}}}}},"previous":{"excerpt":"The purpose of this short article is to remind you how important it is to clean your electronic equipment regularly.
