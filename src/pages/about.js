                I have touched many technologies and languages, but in the Java
                ecosystem, I feel at home. I consider myself very flexible when
                it comes to choosing the technology and the area in which I am
                supposed to work. In my professional career I have dealt with
                backend, devops and frontend. In the latter, I feel the least
                confident, but I'm already catching up.
              </p>

              <p>
                So far I have spent most of my time in multinational teams, so I
                have no problem communicating in English on a daily basis. I
                have completed the SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) course and used it at work, so
                I know what it is like to work in large agile projects. I know
                many good programming practices, design patterns, software
                development techniques. Clean code, TDD, process automation,
                Linux environment are my bread and butter.
              </p>

              <p>
                After work, I often do what I do at work - I program (my own
                toys) and discover new interesting technologies ðŸ™‚. Apart from
                sitting at the computer, I really enjoy being physically active,
                especially with other people. I like to try various activities,
                but volleyball is something that has been with me for years. I
                often pick up a new topic, unknown to me, explore it over the
                next few weeks and try to apply the acquired knowledge in
                practice. Some of the recent ones are: electronics repair, car mechanics,
                plant lighting, stock market and investing, hairdressing, smart home,
                chess, computer graphics, blogging. The topics usually are very diverse ðŸ™‚

                A project for a telecommunications operator providing services

                The aim of the project was to port a part of the ERP-like system

                to Java.

                I was a team leader in the project. The difficulty of this work
                was the lack of documentation for the existing application. I
                remember this project as a lesson. It taught me, above all, how
                dangerous is technological debt and showed me live that when
                deadlines are chasing, adding new programmers to the project is
                the last nail in the coffin.

                I was working on a vehicle simulator to test a platform that

              <p>
                The application was supposed to allow the user to manually draw
                the route of the simulated vehicle and to mark events (such as:
                detection of sign/pedestrian/slippery surface, or connection
                problems) on the map. The drawn scenario was saved to a file and
                then it could be used for a real-time simulation using the
                protobuf protocol.

                I created a website that displays the weather forecast. The
                scope of work included design, implementation and tests (unit
                and functional).
              </p>
              <p>
                The backend was an REST API based on the existing service -{" "}
                <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/">Wunderground</a>. This
                site's API was not entirely consistent and had some design
                flaws. My job was to improve this API by making an adapter.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of the exercises backend was written in both Jersey and
                Vert.x. Due to the limited number of queries to Wunderground
                API, the cache mechanism has also been implemented.
