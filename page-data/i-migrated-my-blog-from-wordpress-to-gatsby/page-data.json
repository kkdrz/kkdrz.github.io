main reason was that I always strived for perfectionism.</p>\n<p>I decided to do everything myself from scratch.\nI do not even remember what technological stack I chose,\nbut the preparation of a template and configuration of the tools took me so much time\nthat I did not even started writing posts.\nThen came examinations in college and after them I have already forgotten about my unsuccessful project.\nAnd to be honest, I did not really want to remember because I was too tired of it.\nI waited for visible effects for too long.</p>\n<h1 id=\"second-attempt\"

href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wordpress</a>.\nI found a template (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/awaken/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Awaken</a>) that more or less met my requirements\nand the next day after I set everything up, I was ready to start writing posts.</p>\n<p>Everything went well as long as I did not mind adjusting the template to myself.\nIntroducing changes in the code of the template did not give me any pleasure.\nI have never used PHP and I did not have the slightest desire to learn it.\nProbably it would not be useful to me anywhere else.</p>\n<p>Using Wordpress was overwhelming.\nI didn’t quite know what was happening in my application.\nIt was hard to create my own functionalities and at the same time I had to worry a lot about security and backups.\nNot a day goes by without someone trying to bruteforce my site or scan it for vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h1

technology that I already knew at least partially\nand which will be useful in my professional career.\nI also wanted to host my website for free (or pay for it as little as possible).\nThat’s why I decided to follow the path of statically generated sites.\n<a href=\"https://jamstack.org/generators/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The list of static site generators</a> is long,\nbut after playing a little bit with the most popular ones I decided to go with <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gatsby</a>.</p>\n<p>The main reason why I chose it was the fact that it is based on <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React</a>.\nI noticed a large demand for React programmers\n(even in a company where I currently work, where we do not have many purely web projects)\nand that’s why I want to practice it a little.</p>\n<h1

Definitely!\nCurrently, the blog is not fully developed yet,\nbut I already feel <strong>a huge improvement in the speed and ease of delivering new functionalities</strong>.\nI’m only limited by my imagination ;)</p>\n<p>Finally <strong>extending my blog functionalities became a pleasure for me</strong>.\nI have always been a fan of generators and WYMIWYG (<em>What You Mean Is What You Get</em>) editors.\nDuring my studies, I preferred to write all my theses and reports in <a href=\"https://www.latex-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">LaTeX</a> instead of MS Word.\nIt seems to me that the same is the case with the creation of my blog.</p>\n<p>Another advantage is that <strong>I don’t have to pay for anything else than the domain</strong>.\nThe blog is hosted on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Github Pages</a>.\nEven if one day this service stops working or is no longer free,\nthere are tons of other places that allow you to host static pages for free.\nMigration is limited to uploading files and changing the IP address in the domain configuration.</p>\n<p>Since my blog now consists of regular static files, <strong>the performance of the site is much better</strong>\nand <strong>I don’t have to worry too much about security issues</strong>.\n<strong>All my posts are written in markdown</strong>, so if I decided to use a different tool in the future, another migration would not be a problem.\nThe posts are likely to be untouched.</p>\n<p>The last important advantage for me is <strong>no need to have a backup copy or website versioning</strong>.\nI don’t have to worry about it, because all the code needed to generate the blog is versioned on Github and on my computer.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I Migrated My Blog From Wordpress to Gatsby","date":"25 April 2021","description":null,"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/5267c/featured.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/7284f/featured.jpg 750w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/29ba9/featured.jpg 1080w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/c8896/featured.jpg 1366w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/5267c/featured.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/b0356/featured.avif 750w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/48f75/featured.avif 1080w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/a5094/featured.avif 1366w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/f46cf/featured.avif 1920w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/57584/featured.webp 750w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/984df/featured.webp 1080w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/4a276/featured.webp 1366w,\n/static/4b0663cbe28e7eebfc013a30cbf155a4/9c00f/featured.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.6666666666666666}}}}},"previous":{"excerpt":"The purpose of this short article is to remind you how important it is to clean your electronic equipment regularly.
